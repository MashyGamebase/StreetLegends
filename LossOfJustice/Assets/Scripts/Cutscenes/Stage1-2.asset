  Dialog:
  - 'Can''t believe I got caught...

    I gotta get out of here'
  - The pickpocket slips into the shadow alley, where a group of rough-looking muggers
    are hanging out. The leader of the muggers, a burly figure with a scar across
    his face, steps forward.
  - "You lookin' a bit jumpy there. \nSomeone on your tail?"
  - 'Some man with a whistle.

    Almost got me.

    Where can I lay low?'
  - We'll deal with 'em if they come snoopin'.
  - 'The trail leads to the mugger''s den.

    Time to take this fight to them.'
